            <h2>Why Would Someone Use AngularJS?</h2>
            <p>
                The dynamic web applications get their structure through AngularJS 
                framework construction. Developers can use HTML to build templates 
                before extending the language syntax to create application components 
                in a simplified and direct way. AngularJS finds its perfect application
                in developing single-page applications (SPAs) due to its two-way data binding
                and dependency injection and modular architecture features.

            <h2>Pros and Cons of AngularJS</h2>
            <div class="lab2-pros">
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                
                    <p><strong>Two-Way Data Binding:</strong> The system performs automatic synchronization between model data and view data to cut down repetitive coding.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Testing becomes easier while reusable components find promotion.</p>
                    <p><strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> The approach supports both independent system modules as well as flexible growth.</p>
                    <p><strong>Community Support:</strong> Documentation remains extensive but the developer community responds less actively to 
                        Angular 1 since alternative frameworks gain more attention.</p>

                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                
                    <p><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> Performance bottlenecks appear during two-way data binding operations within large applications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Steep Learning Curve:</strong> The engineer needs to understand scopes as well as directives and dependency injection.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outdated:</strong> The AngularJS maintenance has ended (as of December 2021) yet developers should opt for Angular
                         (version 2 and above) in new project development.</p>

            <h2>History of AngularJS</h2>
            <p>
                AngularJS originated from Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons 
                during 2009 before Google secured ownership of the project. 
                High popularity developed for AngularJS because it brought novel template-based 
                framework combined with two-way data binding. The discontinuation of active AngularJS 
                development did not prevent it from providing baseline concepts which evolved into modern 
                versions of Angular such as Angular (version 2 and higher).

            <h2>The CLI ng generate command</h2>
                <p>The command creates both Angular components and generates four corresponding files which include TypeScript and HTML template along with CSS and test features. 
                    Four different files appear during creation through this command: TypeScript file, HTML template, CSS file and test file. 
                    The following code represents the produced TypeScript file:</p>
            <pre class="code-block">
        <code>
        import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

          selector: 'app-example',
          templateUrl: './example.component.html',
          styleUrls: ['./example.component.css']
        })
        export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
          constructor() { }
        
          ngOnInit() { }
